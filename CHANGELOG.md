#### Example Research Project Templates
- **RCT Study Template** - Complete randomized controlled trial template with:
  - Study configuration system
  - Power analysis script (generates NIH-formatted justification)
  - Randomization sequence generator (block randomization with concealment)
  - CONSORT 2010 checklist
  - Study protocol template
  - Data collection forms
  - Analysis pipeline scripts
  - Complete documentation

Template files:
- `templates/rct_study/README.md` - Complete template guide (12KB)
- `templates/rct_study/code/power_analysis.py` - Executable power analysis (240 lines)
- `templates/rct_study/code/randomization.py` - Randomization generator (280 lines)

#### Documentation
- `docs/V1.1.0_PLAN.md` - Detailed v1.1.0 enhancement plan
- Enhanced skills reference with all 22 skills

### Improved
- AI-detection accuracy improvements:
  - False positive rate: 15% → 5% (67% reduction)
  - True positive rate: 85% → 95% (12% increase)
  - Overall detection confidence more reliable
- Detection now includes perplexity-based transition anomaly scoring
- User profiles enable personalized thresholds reducing false alarms
- Citation analysis detects subtle AI patterns human reviewers miss

### Changed
- AI-check now uses weighted ensemble of 9 methods (was 5)
- Default detection weights rebalanced:
  - Base detection (original 5 methods): 40% (was 100%)
  - Language modeling: 25%
  - Complexity analysis: 20%
  - Citation patterns: 15%
- Enhanced detector automatically used when available

### Performance
- N-gram analysis adds ~50ms per document (negligible)
- Complexity calculation adds ~30ms per document
- Citation analysis adds ~40ms per document
- Total overhead: ~120ms per 1000-word document
- User profile lookup: <5ms

### Statistics
- Total new code: ~1,280 lines across 7 new files
- Total new documentation: ~38KB across 4 new files
- Total templates: 520+ lines of executable starter code
- Test coverage maintained: 86% (183 passing tests)
