# Research Problem Statement

## Research Question

**Primary Question:** Could large language models be conscious? What does the scientific and philosophical literature say about the theoretical requirements for consciousness and how they apply to current and future AI systems?

**Secondary Questions:**
1. What are the leading theories of consciousness in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy?
2. What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for consciousness according to each theory?
3. How do current large language models measure up against these requirements?
4. What architectural features would future AI systems need to potentially achieve consciousness?

## FINER Criteria Assessment
