## 🚫 What ResearchPilot Is NOT

Important to set correct expectations:

**NOT:**
- ❌ A way to cheat or cut corners
- ❌ A replacement for critical thinking
- ❌ Fully automatic (requires human judgment)
- ❌ A guarantee of degree completion
- ❌ A substitute for advisor guidance

**IS:**
- ✅ A systematic framework for PhD work

## 📜 Legal & Ethical

### License
MIT License (permissive, academic-friendly)

### Ethics Statement
> ResearchPilot is designed to accelerate legitimate academic research while maintaining scientific rigor. It enforces RULE 1 (no aspirational claims without evidence), follows PRISMA 2020 guidelines, and emphasizes reproducibility. It's a tool for efficiency, not a shortcut around critical thinking or original contribution.

### Academic Integrity
> ResearchPilot assists with systematic processes (literature search, screening, analysis) but does not:
> - Write your original contributions
> - Conduct your experiments
> - Make your theoretical insights
> - Replace your advisor relationship
>
> All outputs should be reviewed, validated, and attributed appropriately.
