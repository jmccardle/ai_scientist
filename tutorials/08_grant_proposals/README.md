### Step 2.2: Our Example - First Draft

      SPECIFIC AIMS (Draft v1.0)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Depression affects 15 million Americans annually, with primary care being 
the front line for detection and treatment. However, access to evidence-based 
psychotherapy remains limited, with only 30% of patients receiving adequate 
treatment. Our long-term goal is to increase access to cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) in primary care settings. The objective of this application is 
to test the efficacy of a manualized CBT protocol delivered by primary care 
behavioral health consultants, and to identify implementation strategies that 
maximize reach and effectiveness. Our central hypothesis is that integrated 
CBT will reduce depressive symptoms more than usual care, and that 
implementation strategies targeting organizational readiness will enhance 
adoption.

Despite strong evidence for CBT in specialty mental health, effectiveness in 
real-world primary care remains unclear. Barriers include lack of trained 
therapists, time constraints, and workflow integration challenges. Existing 
trials have been conducted in highly resourced academic medical centers with 
limited generalizability. There is an urgent need for pragmatic trials in 
diverse primary care settings testing both clinical effectiveness and 
implementation strategies.

Our preliminary work demonstrates feasibility of integrated CBT in primary 
care. In a pilot RCT (n=60), we found that primary care behavioral health 
consultants could deliver brief CBT (8 sessions) with fidelity (ICC=0.82) 
and achieve moderate effects on depression (d=0.55). Exit interviews 
revealed patient satisfaction (4.2/5.0) but identified organizational 
barriers to sustained implementation. These findings provide strong 
justification for a fully powered multi-site trial with embedded 
implementation evaluation.

We will test our hypothesis through three Specific Aims:

SPECIFIC AIM 1: Test the effectiveness of integrated CBT for depression in 
primary care. We will conduct a multi-site randomized controlled trial 
comparing integrated CBT (n=200) to enhanced usual care (n=200) across five 
health systems. Working Hypothesis: Integrated CBT will produce clinically 
significant reductions in depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) compared to enhanced 
usual care at 6 months (primary endpoint), sustained at 12 months. 
Expected Outcomes: Effect size d=0.50, number-needed-to-treat (NNT)=4.

SPECIFIC AIM 2: Identify patient-level moderators of treatment response. 
We will examine baseline characteristics (e.g., depression severity, 
comorbid anxiety, trauma history, demographics) that predict differential 
response to integrated CBT. Working Hypothesis: Patients with moderate 
depression and low anxiety will show greatest benefit from CBT, while those 
with severe depression or trauma may require augmentation strategies. 
Expected Outcomes: Identification of patient profiles to guide personalized 
treatment recommendations.

SPECIFIC AIM 3: Compare implementation strategies to maximize CBT adoption 
and fidelity. Using a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation design, 
we will randomly assign sites to standard implementation (training + 
supervision) versus enhanced implementation (training + supervision + 
organizational readiness facilitation). Working Hypothesis: Sites receiving 
enhanced implementation will achieve higher CBT adoption rates, treatment 
fidelity, and patient reach. Expected Outcomes: Identify cost-effective 
implementation strategies for national dissemination.

This project is significant because it will provide definitive evidence for 
integrated CBT in primary care, identify for whom CBT works best, and 
determine how to implement CBT at scale. Findings will inform national 
efforts to expand access to evidence-based psychotherapy. This work aligns 
with NIMH Strategic Plan priorities to reduce the burden of mental illness 
through effective, scalable treatments.

### Step 2.4: Specific Aims - Final Version

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
      SPECIFIC AIMS (Final v2.0)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Depression affects 15 million Americans annually, yet only 30% receive 
adequate treatment—a gap largely due to limited access to evidence-based 
psychotherapy. Primary care, where most depression is detected, presents an 
opportunity to close this gap through integrated cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT). Our long-term goal is to expand access to effective depression 
treatment in primary care. This application tests the effectiveness of brief 
CBT delivered by behavioral health consultants embedded in primary care teams, 
while identifying implementation strategies that maximize reach and fidelity. 
Our central hypothesis: Integrated CBT outperforms usual care, and enhanced 
implementation strategies increase adoption.

Although CBT effectively reduces depression in specialty mental health, its 
effectiveness in real-world primary care remains unclear. Existing trials 
occurred in well-resourced academic centers with limited generalizability. 
Moreover, even when effective treatments exist, implementation barriers—lack 
of trained clinicians, time constraints, workflow disruption—prevent 
widespread adoption. We urgently need pragmatic trials testing both clinical 
effectiveness and implementation strategies across diverse primary care 
settings.

Our pilot RCT (n=60) demonstrated feasibility: Primary care behavioral 
health consultants delivered 8-session CBT with high fidelity (ICC=0.82), 
achieving moderate symptom reduction (d=0.55). Patient satisfaction was high 
(4.2/5.0), but exit interviews revealed organizational barriers to sustained 
use. These findings justify a fully powered multi-site effectiveness-
implementation trial.

Three aims test our central hypothesis:

AIM 1 evaluates clinical effectiveness. Across five health systems, we 
randomize 400 patients with depression (PHQ-9≥10) to integrated CBT (n=200) 
or enhanced usual care (n=200). Hypothesis: CBT produces clinically meaningful 
symptom reductions (≥5-point PHQ-9 decrease) compared to usual care at 6 
months, sustained at 12 months. Expected outcome: Effect size d=0.50, 
number-needed-to-treat=4.

AIM 2 identifies patient profiles predicting treatment response. Baseline 
assessments (depression severity, comorbid anxiety, trauma history, 
demographics) enable moderation analyses. Hypothesis: Moderate depression 
without trauma predicts optimal CBT response; severe depression or PTSD 
requires augmentation. Expected outcome: Precision medicine decision rules 
matching patients to treatment.

AIM 3 compares implementation strategies using a hybrid type 1 design. Sites 
receive standard implementation (training + supervision; n=2 sites, 160 
patients) or enhanced implementation (adding organizational readiness 
facilitation; n=3 sites, 240 patients). Hypothesis: Enhanced implementation 
increases CBT adoption (proportion of eligible patients receiving CBT), 
fidelity (adherence to manual), and reach (patient volume). Expected outcome: 
Cost-effectiveness data for scaling CBT nationally.

This project addresses NIMH priorities by delivering definitive effectiveness 
evidence, precision medicine insights, and scalable implementation strategies. 
Findings inform national efforts expanding access to evidence-based depression 
treatment where patients seek care—primary care.

SIGNIFICANCE

Burden of Depression in Primary Care

Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects 21 million US adults annually [1], 
with primary care settings detecting 80% of cases [2]. Despite guideline 
recommendations for evidence-based psychotherapy [3,4], only 30% of patients 
receive adequate treatment [5]. This treatment gap results in $210 billion 
annual costs [6], 400 million lost workdays [7], and contributes to the 
suicide crisis (45,000 deaths/year) [8]. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated 
this crisis, with depression prevalence doubling in primary care [9]. 
Addressing this treatment gap is a national priority [10].

Racial and ethnic minorities face particularly poor access...

INNOVATION

This project is innovative in several ways:

Pragmatic Multi-Site Design: Unlike prior efficacy trials in academic 
medical centers, we test effectiveness across five diverse health systems 
(safety-net, HMO, academic, rural, VA), enhancing generalizability and 
real-world applicability.

Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Design: We simultaneously test clinical 
effectiveness (Aim 1) and implementation strategies (Aim 3) using a hybrid 
type 1 design [Smith et al., 2020]. This approach accelerates translation 
from research to practice by addressing "what works" and "how to implement" 
in a single trial.

Novel Implementation Strategy: Our organizational readiness facilitation 
combines stakeholder engagement, workflow redesign, and learning health 
system principles—an approach not previously tested for behavioral health 
integration.

Precision Medicine: Aim 2's moderation analyses will generate decision 
rules matching patients to treatment, moving beyond one-size-fits-all 
approaches.

and moderation/mediation tests. He will oversee data quality monitoring and 
guide the data manager. Justification: Multi-site trials with longitudinal 
data and implementation outcomes require dedicated biostatistical expertise.

[Continue for each person...]

Study Coordinators (100% effort each, 5 FTE total): Each site requires a 
full-time coordinator to recruit participants, obtain informed consent, 
randomize using REDCap, schedule CBT sessions, collect outcome data, and 
maintain contact for follow-up assessments. Justification: Based on pilot 
study, one coordinator can manage 50 participants/year, requiring full-time 
effort. Five sites × 1 FTE = 5 coordinators.

B. CONSULTANT COSTS

CBT Expert Supervisor ($4,800/year): Dr. Patricia Williams, a nationally 
recognized CBT expert, will provide monthly video consultation to review 
therapist fidelity and address challenging cases. Justification: Ensuring 
treatment fidelity is critical to internal validity; external expert 
supervision reduces bias compared to internal oversight.

[Continue...]

C. PARTICIPANT COSTS

Incentives are necessary to maximize retention in a 12-month longitudinal 
study. Amounts increase over time ($20 → $30 → $40) to offset participant 
burden and reflect time commitment at each assessment (15 minutes baseline, 
30 minutes 6-month, 45 minutes 12-month including qualitative interview).  
Justification: Pilot study achieved 82% retention with this incentive 
structure.

A. PERSONAL STATEMENT

I am well-qualified to lead this multi-site trial of integrated CBT in 
primary care. My research program focuses on increasing access to evidence-
based psychotherapy through innovative delivery models. Over the past 10 
years, I have successfully completed three NIH-funded RCTs testing behavioral 
interventions in primary care (K23 MH098765, R34 MH109876, R01 MH115432), 
demonstrating my capacity to recruit diverse patient populations, implement 
complex interventions, and publish high-impact findings. I have published 47 
peer-reviewed articles, including 12 in top-tier journals (JAMA, NEJM, JAMA 
Psychiatry), with a current h-index of 28. My recent R01 (MH115432) was 
scored in the 5th percentile, reflecting my track record of scientific rigor 
and innovation. I have mentored 8 doctoral students and 4 postdoctoral 
fellows, three of whom have secured their own K awards. This project builds 
directly on my pilot study (R34 MH109876) demonstrating feasibility of 
primary care CBT, and leverages my extensive collaborations with the five 
participating health systems.

Ongoing Research Support:
R01 MH115432 (Chen, PI) 09/2020-08/2025 "Digital Mental Health Interventions"
  Goals: Test smartphone app for depression self-management
  Role: PI (30% effort)
  No scientific overlap with proposed project

## Part 6: Addressing Reviewer Critiques (Resubmissions) (5 minutes)

### Step 6.1: Understanding Review Critiques

**Common Critiques** (and how to address):

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
   COMMON REVIEWER CRITIQUES & SOLUTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

CRITIQUE 1: "Sample size underpowered for proposed analyses"
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
SOLUTION:
- Recalculate power based on conservative effect sizes
- Add formal power analysis table
- Consider reducing aims or simplifying analyses
- Justify if underpowered exploratory aim

CRITIQUE 2: "Preliminary data insufficient"
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
SOLUTION:
- Conduct pilot study before resubmission
- Add feasibility data (recruitment rates, retention, fidelity)
- Include letters from collaborating sites confirming access

CRITIQUE 3: "Intervention not clearly described"
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
SOLUTION:
- Add detailed intervention manual in appendix
- Include treatment fidelity monitoring plan
- Specify training procedures for interventionists

CRITIQUE 4: "Unclear how aims relate to each other"
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
SOLUTION:
- Add conceptual model diagram showing aim linkages
- Revise Specific Aims to make relationships explicit
- Add "Overview" paragraph in Approach section

CRITIQUE 5: "No plan for addressing missing data"
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
SOLUTION:
- Add detailed retention strategies
- Specify missing data analysis approach (multiple imputation)
- Conduct sensitivity analyses (complete case, worst case)

CRITIQUE 6: "Investigator lacks expertise in [method X]"
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
SOLUTION:
- Add consultant with expertise
- Add co-investigator with relevant skills
- Document training plan to acquire skills
```

**✓ Checkpoint**: Anticipate critiques and address proactively in application.

### Step 6.2: Resubmission Strategy

**If your grant is not funded on first submission (80% are not)**:

```
Resubmission Process:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Step 1: Receive Summary Statement (8 weeks after review)
  - Overall impact score
  - Individual criterion scores (Significance, Innovation, etc.)
  - Written critiques from 3 reviewers
  - Unscored critiques (if scored poorly)

Step 2: Analyze Critiques
  - Identify recurring themes across reviewers
  - Separate major critiques (must address) from minor (optional)
  - Determine if revisions are feasible

Step 3: Decide: Resubmit or Start Fresh?
  RESUBMIT if:
    ✓ Score was close to payline (e.g., 35th percentile, payline 28th)
    ✓ Critiques are addressable
    ✓ Reviewers saw merit in the project
  
  START FRESH if:
    ✗ Score was far from payline (e.g., >50th percentile)
    ✗ Major flaws identified (e.g., "intervention won't work")
    ✗ Reviewers fundamentally misunderstood the aims

Step 4: Revise Application (if resubmitting)
  - 1-page "Introduction to Resubmission" (addresses each critique)
  - Revise Research Strategy based on critiques
  - Update budget if needed
  - Strengthen biosketches with new publications

Step 5: Resubmit (next funding cycle, usually 3-4 months)
  - Clearly mark changes (use response tracking features)
  - Address EVERY critique (even if disagree, explain why)
```

**Example Introduction to Resubmission**:

```
INTRODUCTION TO RESUBMISSION (A1 Submission)

We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful critiques, which substantially 
strengthened this application. Below we address each concern:

CRITIQUE 1 (Reviewers 1, 2): "Sample size may be underpowered for Aim 2 
moderation analyses."

RESPONSE: We agree and have conducted formal power analyses for interaction 
tests (see revised Approach, page 9, Table 3). For a moderator explaining 
10% additional variance, we have 80% power to detect the interaction with 
n=400. We reduced the number of proposed moderators from 7 to 4 (depression 
severity, anxiety, trauma, demographics) to minimize multiple comparisons. 
We clarified that Aim 2 is exploratory and hypothesis-generating, with 
definitive testing of identified moderators reserved for future trials.

CRITIQUE 2 (Reviewer 3): "Unclear how organizational readiness facilitation 
will be standardized across sites in Aim 3."

RESPONSE: We added a detailed description of the OBRification protocol (see 
Approach, pages 10-11) including: (1) stakeholder engagement toolkit, (2) 
workflow assessment checklist, and (3) standardized facilitation manual. 
We also added fidelity monitoring: 20% of facilitation sessions will be 
audio-recorded and rated for adherence to the protocol. The facilitation 
manual is included as Appendix A.

[Continue for all critiques...]

SUMMARY: The revised application addresses all critiques through improved 
power analyses, detailed implementation protocols, and enhanced feasibility 
data. We are confident these revisions substantially strengthen the scientific 
rigor and impact of this project.
```

**✓ Checkpoint**: Resubmission systematically addresses every critique.
