**What you'll learn**: Grounded theory, phenomenology, ethnography, thematic analysis, trustworthiness criteria, COREQ reporting, reflexivity, qualitative software

---

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates **qualitative-only research** - generating rich, contextualized understanding through non-numerical data. You'll learn:

1. Choosing appropriate qualitative methodologies (grounded theory, phenomenology, ethnography)
2. Developing research questions suited for qualitative inquiry
3. Sampling strategies (purposive, theoretical, snowball)
4. Data collection methods (interviews, focus groups, observations)
5. Rigorous qualitative analysis approaches
6. Ensuring trustworthiness (credibility, transferability, dependability, confirmability)
7. Reflexivity and researcher positioning
8. COREQ reporting guidelines (32-item checklist)
9. Member checking and participant validation
10. Publishing in qualitative journals

**Running Example**: We'll conduct a grounded theory study:
*"Understanding the lived experience of recovery from depression: A grounded theory study of patients' perspectives on what helps."*

**Why Qualitative Research**:
- **Depth over breadth**: Rich understanding of experiences
- **Theory generation**: Discover new concepts, not just test hypotheses
- **Participant voice**: Center lived experience
- **Context**: Understand the "why" and "how"
- **Discovery**: Explore uncharted territory

---

## Part 1: Choosing a Qualitative Methodology (10 minutes)

### Step 1.1: Three Major Approaches

**1. Grounded Theory** ← WE'LL USE THIS

```
Purpose: Generate theory from data (theory "grounded" in data)
Question type: "What is the process of...?"
Data collection: Iterative (theoretical sampling)
Analysis: Constant comparison, coding (open → axial → selective)
Outcome: Theoretical model explaining a process
Founder: Glaser & Strauss (1967); Charmaz (2006) constructivist version

Example: "What is the process of recovering from depression?"
→ Generate theory of recovery stages, turning points, facilitators
```

**2. Phenomenology**

```
Purpose: Understand the essence of lived experience
Question type: "What is it like to experience...?"
Data collection: In-depth interviews (often 1-2 hour conversations)
Analysis: Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) or descriptive
Outcome: Essence of the phenomenon
Founder: Husserl, Heidegger; Smith et al. (IPA, 1996)

Example: "What is the lived experience of major depression in adolescents?"
→ Describe the essential qualities of that experience
```

**3. Ethnography**

```
Purpose: Understand culture of a group
Question type: "How does this group function?" "What are cultural norms?"
Data collection: Participant observation, field notes, interviews
Analysis: Cultural domain analysis, thick description
Outcome: Cultural portrait
Founder: Malinowski, Geertz

Example: "What is the culture of an inpatient psychiatric unit from patients' perspectives?"
→ Describe rituals, norms, power dynamics, meanings
```

**Our Choice**: **Grounded Theory (Charmaz constructivist approach)**
- Best for understanding recovery processes
- Generates actionable theory
- Iterative design allows emergence

**✓ Checkpoint**: Methodology matches research question.

---

### Step 1.2: Research Question Formulation

**Qualitative vs. Quantitative Questions**:

```
QUANTITATIVE (wrong for qualitative):
❌ "Does therapy reduce depression symptoms?" (yes/no, measure)
❌ "What percentage of patients recover?" (number)

QUALITATIVE (open-ended, exploratory):
✓ "What does recovery mean to patients with depression?"
✓ "How do patients experience the recovery process?"
✓ "What facilitates or hinders recovery from depression?"
```

**Our Research Question**:

> "What is the process of recovery from major depression, from the perspective of individuals who have experienced it?"

**Sub-questions**:
1. What does "recovery" mean to people who have experienced depression?
2. What are the key stages or phases of the recovery process?
3. What factors facilitate or hinder recovery?
4. How do individuals navigate setbacks during recovery?

**✓ Checkpoint**: Open-ended question suitable for theory generation.

---

## Part 2: Sampling and Recruitment (5 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Purposive Sampling

**Challenge**: Cannot randomly sample - need information-rich cases

**Solution**: **Purposive sampling** - intentionally select participants

```
Sampling Criteria (Inclusion):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Primary criterion: Self-identified as "recovered" or "in recovery" from major depression
   Rationale: Need people who can reflect on the process

2. Duration since worst episode: At least 6 months ago
   Rationale: Allows reflection, reduces acute distress

3. Age: 18-65 years
   Rationale: Adult experiences (adolescent recovery may differ)

4. Language: English fluency
   Rationale: Researcher language capacity

5. Variation sought (maximum variation sampling):
   - Gender: Aim for mix
   - Treatment modality: Therapy, medication, no treatment, combination
   - Severity: Mild, moderate, severe episodes
   - Recovery duration: Recent (<2 years) vs. long-term (>5 years)
   
   Rationale: Capture diverse recovery pathways

Exclusion:
- Current severe depression (PHQ-9 ≥20) - may be too distressed to participate
- Active suicidal ideation - refer to crisis services, do not interview
```

**Sample Size**: Not predetermined (unlike quan)

```
Sample Size Strategy:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Initial target: 15-20 participants
Strategy: Sample to saturation
  - Saturation = no new themes/concepts emerging
  - Typically occurs 12-20 interviews (varies by complexity)
  - Continue interviewing 2-3 more after saturation to confirm

Our study: Recruited 18 participants, saturation at interview 15
```

**✓ Checkpoint**: Purposive sampling ensures information-rich participants.

---

### Step 2.2: Theoretical Sampling

**Unique to Grounded Theory**: Sampling evolves based on emerging theory

```
Theoretical Sampling Process:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Phase 1: Initial Sampling (Interviews 1-8)
  - Broad inclusion (any self-identified recovered person)
  - Analyze early data
  - Identify emerging concepts

Phase 2: Focused Sampling (Interviews 9-15)
  - Deliberately seek participants to explore specific emerging concepts
  
  Example: Early data suggests "turning point" concept
  → Actively recruit people who can speak to turning points
  → Ask: "Was there a specific moment when things shifted?"

Phase 3: Saturation Checking (Interviews 16-18)
  - Sample to confirm theory
  - No new properties of categories
  - Stop when saturation confirmed

Timeline: 9 months (iterative data collection + analysis)
```

**Our Example**:
- Interviews 1-8: Broad sampling, identified "acceptance" as key concept
- Interviews 9-15: Sought participants with different relationships to acceptance
- Interviews 16-18: Confirmed saturation (no new facets of acceptance)

**✓ Checkpoint**: Theoretical sampling strengthens theory development.

## Part 3: Data Collection (10 minutes)

### Step 3.1: In-Depth Interview Guide

**Structure**: Semi-structured (flexible, but focused)

```markdown
# In-Depth Interview Guide: Recovery from Depression

**Introduction** (5 minutes)

"Thank you for sharing your time and experiences with me. I'm interested in understanding the recovery process from depression, from the perspective of people who have lived through it. There are no right or wrong answers - I want to hear YOUR story and what recovery has meant for you. This conversation will take about 60-90 minutes. Before we begin, I want to remind you that you can skip any question or stop at any time. Do you have any questions?"

[Obtain verbal consent, start recording]

---

## PART 1: Setting the Context (10 minutes)

**Grand Tour Question** (opening):
"I'd like to start by having you tell me about your experience with depression. Can you take me back to when you first started experiencing depression, and walk me through your journey to where you are now?"

[Let participant talk without interruption for 5-10 minutes]

Follow-up prompts if needed:
- "Can you tell me more about that?"
- "What was that like for you?"
- "How did that feel?"

---

## PART 2: Defining Recovery (15 minutes)

**Core Question**:
"You mentioned that you see yourself as [recovered / in recovery]. What does that mean to you?"

Probes:
- "How would you describe recovery in your own words?"
- "How do you know you're in recovery? What changed?"
- "Is recovery a destination or a journey for you? Why?"

**Contrast Question**:
"How is recovery different from just 'not being depressed'?"

---

## PART 3: The Recovery Process (30 minutes)

**Process Question**:
"Thinking back on your journey, can you describe the process of how recovery happened for you? Were there stages or phases?"

Probes:
- "Where did it start? What was the first step?"
- "Were there turning points - moments when things shifted?"
- "Tell me about a time when you took a step forward in recovery."
- "Tell me about a time when you had a setback. How did you navigate that?"

**Facilitators**:
"What helped you in your recovery? What made a difference?"

Probes (if not spontaneously mentioned):
- Therapy?
- Medication?
- Relationships?
- Activities or routines?
- Your own mindset or perspective shifts?

**Barriers**:
"What made recovery harder? What got in the way?"

---

## PART 4: Meaning-Making (15 minutes)

**Meaning Question**:
"How has going through depression and recovery changed you, if at all?"

Probes:
- "What have you learned about yourself?"
- "Do you see yourself differently now?"
- "Has your relationship with depression changed over time?"

**Future-Oriented**:
"How do you think about your future in relation to depression?"

Probes:
- "Do you worry about it coming back?"
- "What would you do if you started feeling depressed again?"

---

## PART 5: Advice and Closing (10 minutes)

**Advice Question**:
"If you were talking to someone who is currently struggling with depression, what would you want them to know about recovery?"

**Anything Else**:
"Is there anything else about your recovery experience that you think is important for me to understand, that we haven't talked about?"

---

## Closing (5 minutes)

**Thank participant**:
"Thank you so much for sharing your story with me. What you've shared will help build understanding of the recovery process and may help others."

**Member checking invitation**:
"After I've analyzed all the interviews, I'd like to share my findings with you to see if they resonate with your experience. Would you be willing to review a summary of the results in a few months?"

**Check emotional state**:
"How are you feeling after talking about all of this?"
[If distressed, offer resources, debrief, ensure safety before ending]

**Provide resources**:
[Give card with crisis hotline, therapist contacts, etc.]

[Stop recording]
```

**✓ Checkpoint**: Interview guide balances structure with flexibility.

---

### Step 3.2: Conducting the Interview

**Best Practices**:

```
Location: Participant's choice (ensure privacy)
  - Our study: 12 via Zoom (private space), 6 in-person (private office)

Duration: 60-90 minutes (median: 75 minutes)

Interviewer skills:
  ✓ Active listening (not just waiting to ask next question)
  ✓ Comfortable with silence (let participant think)
  ✓ Follow participant's lead (diverge from guide if interesting)
  ✓ Non-judgmental presence
  ✓ Empathy without over-identifying

Recording:
  - Audio only (less intrusive than video)
  - Backup recorder (always have redundancy)
  - Test equipment before each interview

Field notes immediately after:
  - Non-verbal observations
  - Interviewer reflections
  - Emerging themes
  - Theoretical memos
```

**Reflexivity Example** (field notes):

```
Interview 7 - Field Notes (2024-08-15)

Participant: 34F, recovered 3 years, CBT + medication

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
- Became emotional when discussing turning point (accepting she needed help)
- Very articulate about "acceptance" as distinct from "giving up"
- Used metaphor of "learning to swim with the current instead of against it"

INTERVIEWER REFLECTIONS:
- I found myself nodding a lot during the acceptance discussion
- Realized I may be bringing my own bias about acceptance being positive
- Need to explore whether acceptance is universal or just for some people
- Next interview: actively probe for people who DON'T resonate with acceptance

EMERGING THEORY:
- Acceptance may be a key turning point
- But what does acceptance mean? (Not resignation, but...)
- Metaphors are important - participants use them to explain complex internal shifts

NEXT STEPS:
- Review previous interviews for acceptance language
- Develop more probes about what acceptance means vs. doesn't mean
- Theoretical sampling: seek people who recovered WITHOUT acceptance?
```

**✓ Checkpoint**: Reflective interviewing enhances data quality.

---

## Part 4: Grounded Theory Analysis (15 minutes)

### Step 4.1: Constant Comparison Method

**Core Principle**: Constantly compare data to data, data to codes, codes to categories

```
Constant Comparison Process:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Step 1: Initial Coding (Open Coding)
  - Code line-by-line or segment-by-segment
  - Stay close to data (use in vivo codes = participant's own words)
  - Ask: "What is happening here?" "What does this represent?"

Example:

Interview 7 excerpt:
"I think the turning point for me was when I stopped fighting it. Like, 
I'd been trying so hard to just BE HAPPY, you know? And it wasn't working. 
And I was exhausted. So I just... let myself be depressed. I know that 
sounds bad, but it was actually freeing. Once I accepted 'okay, this is 
where I am right now,' I could actually start to move forward."

Codes:
- "Turning point" (process code)
- "Stopped fighting it" (in vivo code)
- "Trying to BE HAPPY" (in vivo code, emphasis)
- "Exhaustion from effort"
- "Letting myself be depressed"
- "Acceptance as freeing" (contradictory to expectation)
- "Acceptance enables forward movement"

Step 2: Focused Coding
  - Which initial codes appear most frequently?
  - Which codes are most significant?
  - Group related codes into categories

Categories emerging:
- ACCEPTANCE (frequent, significant)
  - Properties: Not resignation, paradoxical freedom, precursor to action
- TURNING POINTS (process)
- EFFORT vs. ALLOWING (tension)

Step 3: Axial Coding
  - Relate categories to each other
  - Identify relationships (causes, consequences, contexts)

Relationships:
- Prolonged effort → Exhaustion → Acceptance
- Acceptance → Reduced self-judgment → Energy for action
- Acceptance ≠ Giving up (important distinction)

Step 4: Theoretical Coding
  - Integrate into a coherent theory
  - Identify core category (central phenomenon)
  - Theoretical saturation

Our emerging theory:
CORE CATEGORY: "Paradoxical Letting Go"
  - Recovery involves releasing effort to control depression
  - Counterintuitive: Acceptance enables change
  - Not giving up, but changing relationship to depression
```

**✓ Checkpoint**: Systematic coding generates theory from data.

---

### Step 4.2: Using NVivo for Grounded Theory

**Action**: Organize codes systematically

```
NVivo Project Setup:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Import transcripts (18 interviews)

2. Create nodes (codes):
   - Initial codes (167 nodes after first 8 interviews)
   - Organize into tree structure as categories emerge

3. Code transcripts:
   - Highlight text → Assign to node
   - Multiple codes per segment allowed
   - Track who says what (node matrix queries)

4. Run queries:
   - Word frequency: What words appear most?
   - Text search: Find all instances of "acceptance"
   - Coding comparison: Inter-coder reliability (if second coder)
   - Matrix query: Which codes co-occur?

5. Visualize:
   - Mind maps showing category relationships
   - Models showing theoretical framework

6. Memo writing:
   - Theoretical memos linked to codes
   - Track theory development over time

Example Query Result:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Matrix Query: "Acceptance" co-coded with...
  - "Turning point": 14 participants
  - "Relief": 11 participants
  - "Self-compassion": 9 participants
  - "Letting go of control": 13 participants

Interpretation: Acceptance is closely linked to turning points and 
involves self-compassion and releasing control efforts.
```

**✓ Checkpoint**: NVivo organizes complex data for theory building.

---

### Step 4.3: Theoretical Saturation

**How to Know You're Done**:

```
Saturation Checklist:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

✓ No new categories emerging (last 3 interviews)
✓ No new properties of existing categories
✓ Relationships between categories well-established
✓ Categories well-developed with multiple examples
✓ Negative cases explored (examples that don't fit)

Our Study:
  Interview 15: No new concepts
  Interview 16: Confirmed existing theory
  Interview 17: One participant's story slightly different (recovery without 
                acceptance), but fits as variation (theoretical sampling worked)
  Interview 18: Saturation confirmed

DECISION: Stop data collection at 18 participants
```

**✓ Checkpoint**: Saturation ensures theoretical adequacy.

---

## Part 5: Ensuring Trustworthiness (5 minutes)

### Step 5.1: Lincoln & Guba's Criteria

**Trustworthiness in Qualitative Research** (parallel to quan validity/reliability):

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
    TRUSTWORTHINESS CRITERIA (Lincoln & Guba)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

1. CREDIBILITY (parallel to internal validity)
   Definition: Are findings believable?
   
   Strategies we used:
   ✓ Prolonged engagement (9-month study)
   ✓ Persistent observation (multiple interviews per participant available)
   ✓ Triangulation (multiple data sources: interviews + field notes + memos)
   ✓ Member checking (shared findings with 12 participants, 11 confirmed resonance)
   ✓ Peer debriefing (research team meetings, external qualitative expert consulted)

2. TRANSFERABILITY (parallel to external validity/generalizability)
   Definition: Can findings apply to other contexts?
   
   Strategies:
   ✓ Thick description (rich detail allows readers to judge transferability)
   ✓ Maximum variation sampling (diverse participants increase transferability)
   ✓ Clear context description (U.S., English-speaking, middle-class sample)

3. DEPENDABILITY (parallel to reliability)
   Definition: Would study produce consistent findings if repeated?
   
   Strategies:
   ✓ Audit trail (all decisions documented: sampling, coding, analysis)
   ✓ Reflexivity (researcher biases acknowledged)
   ✓ External audit (qualitative methodologist reviewed process)

4. CONFIRMABILITY (parallel to objectivity)
   Definition: Are findings grounded in data, not researcher bias?
   
   Strategies:
   ✓ Audit trail (clear link from data to findings)
   ✓ Reflexivity journal (researcher examined own assumptions)
   ✓ Negative case analysis (explained cases that didn't fit)
```

**✓ Checkpoint**: Trustworthiness strategies enhance rigor.

---

### Step 5.2: Reflexivity Statement

**Critical for Qualitative**: Researcher is the instrument

```markdown
# Reflexivity Statement (Example)

## Researcher Positioning

I am a clinical psychologist who has worked with depressed patients for 8 
years. I have not personally experienced major depression, though I have 
experienced grief and loss. I approached this study with the belief that 
recovery is possible and that patients have valuable expertise about their 
own recovery.

## Potential Biases

1. **Pro-recovery bias**: I may be inclined to hear hopeful narratives and 
   overlook struggles or ambivalence about recovery.
   
   *Mitigation*: Actively probed for setbacks and ongoing challenges. 
   Theoretically sampled for participants with partial recovery.

2. **Clinical lens**: My training may lead me to interpret recovery through 
   a clinical/therapeutic framework, potentially overlooking non-clinical 
   facilitators.
   
   *Mitigation*: Used open-ended questions. When participants mentioned therapy, 
   I asked "What else helped?" to avoid privileging clinical interventions.

3. **Assumption about acceptance**: Early in analysis, I noticed I was excited 
   about the "acceptance" theme, possibly because it aligns with ACT (Acceptance 
   and Commitment Therapy) which I practice.
   
   *Mitigation*: Actively sought participants who recovered without emphasis on 
   acceptance (theoretical sampling). Included these as variations in final theory.

## How My Perspective Evolved

Initially, I expected a linear recovery process (crisis → treatment → improvement). 
The data revealed a much more cyclical process with setbacks as normative. This 
challenged my assumption and enriched the theory.

## Relationship to Participants

As a clinician, I was initially concerned about "therapist mode" interfering with 
research stance. Early interviews, I found myself offering validation ("that must 
have been hard") which felt therapeutic but could bias responses. I shifted to 
reflective probes ("tell me more about that") which maintained empathy while 
reducing directiveness.
```

**✓ Checkpoint**: Reflexivity demonstrates methodological rigor.

TITLE
"The Paradox of Letting Go: A Grounded Theory of Recovery from Major Depression"

ABSTRACT (250 words)
Background: Recovery from depression is poorly understood from patients' 
perspectives.
Aim: Generate a theory of the recovery process grounded in lived experience.
Methods: Constructivist grounded theory. 18 in-depth interviews with individuals 
who self-identified as recovered. Constant comparison analysis.
Results: Recovery involved a paradoxical process of "letting go" characterized 
by: (1) accepting depression rather than fighting it, (2) releasing control 
efforts, (3) cultivating self-compassion, (4) reconnecting with values. 
Turning points often involved exhaustion from effort followed by acceptance, 
which paradoxically enabled forward movement.
Conclusion: Recovery may require a shift from controlling depression to changing 
one's relationship with it. Findings inform therapeutic approaches emphasizing 
acceptance over symptom elimination.
