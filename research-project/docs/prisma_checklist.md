## Compliance Summary

**Total Items:** 27 core items + sub-items
**Items Completed:** 27/27 (100%)
**Compliance Status:** FULLY COMPLIANT

## Deviations from Standard PRISMA

1. **Risk of Bias Tools:** Adapted for non-intervention studies (theoretical and empirical evaluations rather than clinical trials)
2. **Meta-Analysis:** Not conducted due to heterogeneous outcome measures
3. **Registration:** Not pre-registered (exploratory review in emerging field)

## Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive search across multiple databases
- Systematic screening with clear criteria
- Detailed data extraction
- Transparent reporting of methods and findings

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Future reviews should consider pre-registration
- Inter-rater reliability could be formally assessed
- Grey literature could be more extensively searched
