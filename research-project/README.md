# Systematic Literature Review: Metacognition in Large Language Models

## Project Overview

This repository contains a complete PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic literature review examining metacognition, self-awareness, and introspection capabilities in large language models (LLMs).

**Review Date:** November 14, 2024
**Studies Reviewed:** 25 empirical studies from 2024
**Compliance:** PRISMA 2020 (27/27 items satisfied)

## Research Questions

1. How is metacognition evaluated in large language models?
2. Can LLMs demonstrate self-awareness or situational awareness?
3. What evidence exists for or against LLM self-modeling capabilities?

## Key Findings

- **Measurable but Limited:** LLMs demonstrate above-chance metacognitive abilities that remain far below human levels
- **Reasoning-Awareness Gap:** Consistent dissociation between problem-solving ability and understanding of reasoning processes
- **Enhancement Potential:** 15-40% performance improvements possible through targeted metacognitive interventions
- **Safety Concerns:** Poorest metacognitive performance in high-stakes domains where it's most critical

## Quick Statistics

- **Databases Searched:** 5 (OpenAlex, arXiv, Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, ACL Anthology)
- **Records Identified:** 41
- **Studies Included:** 25
- **Evaluation Methods:** 5 major paradigms identified
- **Models Evaluated:** GPT-4 (18 studies), GPT-3.5 (12), Claude (8), LLaMA (6), Others (9)

## Key Theoretical Contributions

1. **Identified Evaluation Paradigms:**
   - Confidence calibration tasks
   - Neuroscience-inspired monitoring
   - Self-correction assessments
   - Complexity estimation
   - Memory limitation awareness

2. **Evidence Synthesis:**
   - Limited but measurable metacognitive capabilities
   - Task-specific rather than general abilities
   - Significant enhancement potential
   - Critical safety limitations

3. **Future Directions:**
   - Spontaneous metacognitive monitoring
   - Unified self-model architectures
   - Cross-domain transfer mechanisms
   - Developmental approaches

## Usage

### For Researchers
- Use the search strategy for replication or updates
- Reference the evaluation paradigms for new studies
- Build on identified gaps and limitations

### For Practitioners
- Review safety implications before deployment
- Implement recommended validation procedures
- Consider human oversight requirements

### For Educators
- Understand current capabilities and limitations
- Use findings to inform AI literacy curricula
- Reference theoretical frameworks
