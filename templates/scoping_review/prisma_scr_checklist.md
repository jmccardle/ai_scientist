| **INTRODUCTION** | | | | |
| Rationale | 3 | Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known. Explain why the review questions/objectives lend themselves to a scoping review approach. | ☐ | Page __ |
| Objectives | 4 | Provide an explicit statement of the questions and objectives being addressed with reference to their key elements (e.g., population or participants, concepts, and context) or other relevant key elements used to conceptualize the review questions and/or objectives. | ☐ | Page __ |
| **METHODS** | | | | |
| Protocol and registration | 5 | Indicate whether a review protocol exists; state if and where it can be accessed (e.g., a Web address); and if available, provide registration information, including the registration number. | ☐ | Page __ |
| Eligibility criteria | 6 | Specify characteristics of the sources of evidence used as eligibility criteria (e.g., years considered, language, and publication status), and provide a rationale. | ☐ | Page __ |
| Information sources* | 7 | Describe all information sources in the search (e.g., databases with dates of coverage and contact with authors to identify additional sources), as well as the date the most recent search was executed. | ☐ | Page __ |
| Search | 8 | Present the full electronic search strategy for at least 1 database, including any limits used, such that it could be repeated. | ☐ | Appendix / Page __ |

| Data charting process‡ | 10 | Describe the methods of charting data from the included sources of evidence (e.g., calibrated forms or forms that have been tested by the team before their use, and whether data charting was done independently or in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators. | ☐ | Page __ |
| Data items | 11 | List and define all variables for which data were sought and any assumptions and simplifications made. | ☐ | Page __ |
| Critical appraisal of individual sources of evidence§ | 12 | If done, provide a rationale for conducting a critical appraisal of included sources of evidence; describe the methods used and how this information was used in any data synthesis (if appropriate). | ☐ | Page __ / N/A |
| Synthesis of results | 13 | Describe the methods of handling and summarizing the data that were charted. | ☐ | Page __ |
| **RESULTS** | | | | |
| Selection of sources of evidence | 14 | Give numbers of sources of evidence screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage, ideally using a flow diagram. | ☐ | Page __ / Figure __ |
| Characteristics of sources of evidence | 15 | For each source of evidence, present characteristics for which data were charted and provide the citations. | ☐ | Page __ / Table __ |
| Critical appraisal within sources of evidence | 16 | If done, present data on critical appraisal of included sources of evidence (see item 12). | ☐ | Page __ / N/A |
| Results of individual sources of evidence | 17 | For each included source of evidence, present the relevant data that were charted that relate to the review questions and objectives. | ☐ | Page __ / Table __ |
| Synthesis of results | 18 | Summarize and/or present the charting results as they relate to the review questions and objectives. | ☐ | Page __ |
| **DISCUSSION** | | | | |
| Summary of evidence | 19 | Summarize the main results (including an overview of concepts, themes, and types of evidence available), link to the review questions and objectives, and consider the relevance to key groups. | ☐ | Page __ |
| Limitations | 20 | Discuss the limitations of the scoping review process. | ☐ | Page __ |
| Conclusions | 21 | Provide a general interpretation of the results with respect to the review questions and objectives, as well as potential implications and/or next steps. | ☐ | Page __ |

**Footnotes from PRISMA-ScR:**

*Information sources – where the search was conducted (e.g., databases, registers).

†Selection of sources of evidence – the inclusion and exclusion criteria for sources of evidence.
