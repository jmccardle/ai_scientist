## Inter-Rater Reliability Pilot

**For first 10% of records:**

| Record ID | Screener 1 | Screener 2 | Agreement? | Resolution |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 1 | YES | YES | ✓ | - |
| 2 | NO | YES | ✗ | Discuss → YES |
| 3 | YES | YES | ✓ | - |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Calculate Cohen's Kappa (κ):**

```
Agreement: [n] / [total] = [%]
Cohen's κ = [value]

Interpretation:
- κ > 0.80: Excellent agreement
- κ 0.60-0.80: Substantial agreement ✓ (target)
- κ 0.40-0.60: Moderate agreement (clarify criteria, re-pilot)
- κ < 0.40: Poor agreement (major revision needed)
```

**If κ < 0.60:**
1. Review discrepancies
2. Clarify screening criteria
3. Re-pilot with additional 10% sample
4. Recalculate κ
