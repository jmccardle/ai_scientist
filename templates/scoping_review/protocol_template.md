## 2. BACKGROUND

### Rationale

[Why is this scoping review needed? What is the current state of knowledge?]

**Structure:**
- Describe the topic and its importance
- Summarize existing knowledge
- Identify gaps or uncertainties
- Explain why a scoping review (not systematic review) is appropriate

**Example:**
```
Chronic diseases account for 71% of global mortality, with the burden 
disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). 
Mobile health (mHealth) interventions—including SMS reminders, mobile apps, 
and wearables—offer promise for supporting self-management in resource-limited 
settings.

While several systematic reviews have synthesized evidence on mHealth 
effectiveness for specific conditions (e.g., diabetes), the breadth of mHealth 
approaches, target populations, and implementation contexts in LMICs remains 
unclear. A scoping review is appropriate to map this heterogeneous literature, 
identify research gaps, and inform future systematic reviews and implementation 
initiatives.
```

---

## 3. OBJECTIVES

### Research Question(s)

[State 1-3 broad research questions]

**Format:** Use PCC framework (Population, Concept, Context)

**Example:**
```
Primary Research Question:
"What is known about mobile health interventions for chronic disease 
self-management in low- and middle-income countries?"

Secondary Research Questions:
1. What types of mHealth interventions have been studied for chronic disease 
   self-management in LMICs?
2. Which chronic diseases and populations have been targeted?
3. What outcomes and implementation factors have been reported?
4. What are the key research gaps?
```

### PCC Framework

| Element | Definition | This Review |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Population** | Who? (patients, providers, settings) | [Define] |
| **Concept** | What? (intervention, phenomenon, experience) | [Define] |
| **Context** | Where? (setting, culture, geography) | [Define] |

**Example:**
```
P = Adults (≥18 years) with chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, COPD, 
    heart disease, chronic kidney disease)
C = Mobile health (mHealth) interventions for self-management support 
    (SMS, apps, wearables, voice calls)
C = Low- and middle-income countries (per World Bank classification)
```
