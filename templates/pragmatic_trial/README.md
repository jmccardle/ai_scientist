## What is a Pragmatic Trial?

A **pragmatic trial** evaluates interventions under real-world conditions to inform clinical and policy decision-making about whether an intervention works in routine practice.

**Pragmatic vs. Explanatory Trials:**

```
EXPLANATORY TRIAL                    PRAGMATIC TRIAL
(Can it work?)                       (Does it work?)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Highly selected participants    →   Broad, representative sample
Strict protocol adherence       →   Flexible implementation
Specialized research settings   →   Routine care settings
Close monitoring & support      →   Usual care delivery
Intermediate/surrogate outcomes →   Patient-important outcomes
Ideal conditions                →   Real-world conditions
Internal validity focus         →   External validity focus
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CONTINUUM: Most trials fall somewhere in between
```

**When to conduct a pragmatic trial:**
- Intervention has efficacy evidence (proven to work under ideal conditions)
- Need to know if it works in real-world practice
- Want to inform clinical guidelines or policy decisions
- Target broad, heterogeneous population
- Implementation/delivery flexibility is important

---

## PRECIS-2 Tool (9 Domains)

**PRECIS-2** assesses how pragmatic a trial is across 9 domains, each scored 1-5:

```
Score 1 = Very Explanatory (ideal, controlled conditions)
Score 5 = Very Pragmatic (real-world, routine conditions)
```

### Domain 1: ELIGIBILITY

**Who is eligible to participate?**

```
1 (Explanatory)                            5 (Pragmatic)
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
Highly selected,                          All patients who
strict inclusion                          would receive
criteria                                  intervention in
                                          practice

Example (Diabetes Trial):
Explanatory (1): HbA1c 7.5-9.0%, no comorbidities, age 40-60
Pragmatic (5): Any adult with T2DM receiving care at clinic
```

**Pragmatic Approach:**
- Minimal exclusion criteria
- Only exclude if unsafe or unethical
- Reflect real-world patient heterogeneity
- Include patients typically excluded from efficacy trials (comorbidities, elderly, minorities)

### Domain 2: RECRUITMENT

**How are participants identified and recruited?**

```
1 (Explanatory)                            5 (Pragmatic)
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
Extensive screening,                      Recruited from
advertising,                              usual care pathway
incentives                                as they present

Example:
Explanatory (1): Mass media ads, travel reimbursement, $500 incentive
Pragmatic (5): Clinician identifies eligible patients during visits
```

**Pragmatic Approach:**
- Recruit from usual care settings (clinics, hospitals)
- Minimal additional screening beyond routine
- No/minimal financial incentives
- Providers identify eligible patients

### Domain 3: SETTING

**Where is the trial conducted?**

```
1 (Explanatory)                            5 (Pragmatic)
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
Specialized                               Typical care
research centers                          settings where
                                          intervention
                                          would be used

Example:
Explanatory (1): Academic medical center research clinic
Pragmatic (5): 50 diverse community primary care practices
```

**Pragmatic Approach:**
- Routine care settings (primary care, community hospitals)
- Multiple diverse sites
- Variation in resources and staffing
- Where intervention would actually be delivered

### Domain 4: ORGANISATION

**What expertise/resources are required to deliver intervention?**

```
1 (Explanatory)                            5 (Pragmatic)
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
Highly specialized                        Intervention
providers, intensive                      delivered by
training, extra                           usual providers
resources                                 with usual
                                          training/resources

Example:
Explanatory (1): PhD psychologists, 40-hour training, research coordinators
Pragmatic (5): Practice counselors, 2-hour training, existing staff
```

**Pragmatic Approach:**
- Usual care providers deliver intervention
- Minimal additional training (scalable)
- No extra staff hired for trial
- Use existing resources and workflows

### Domain 5: FLEXIBILITY (Delivery)

**How much flexibility in how intervention is delivered?**

```
1 (Explanatory)                            5 (Pragmatic)
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
Strict protocol,                          Providers adapt
no deviations                             intervention to
allowed                                   patient needs and
                                          practice context

Example:
Explanatory (1): 12 sessions × 60 min, fixed content, protocol deviations = withdrawal
Pragmatic (5): 8-16 sessions, flexible length, adapt to patient
```

**Pragmatic Approach:**
- Flexibility to adapt to local context
- Allow clinical judgment
- Accommodate patient preferences
- Fidelity to core components, not exact protocol

### Domain 6: FLEXIBILITY (Adherence)

**What measures are taken to improve/monitor adherence?**

```
1 (Explanatory)                            5 (Pragmatic)
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
Intensive adherence                       No adherence
support, frequent                         support beyond
monitoring, protocol                      usual care
for non-adherence

Example:
Explanatory (1): Weekly calls, pill counts, adherence counseling, exclusion if <80%
Pragmatic (5): No additional adherence monitoring
```

**Pragmatic Approach:**
- No trial-specific adherence interventions
- Usual care adherence support only
- Reflects real-world adherence
- Include non-adherent patients in analysis (ITT)

### Domain 7: FOLLOW-UP

**How closely are participants followed?**

```
1 (Explanatory)                            5 (Pragmatic)
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
Frequent visits,                          Follow-up
extensive data                            coincides with
collection, minimize                      routine care,
loss to follow-up                         minimal extra
                                          effort to retain

Example:
Explanatory (1): Monthly in-person visits, travel reimbursement, retention bonuses
Pragmatic (5): Annual routine care visits, EHR data extraction
```

**Pragmatic Approach:**
- Follow-up aligns with routine care schedule
- Data from medical records/registries
- Minimal burden on participants and staff
- Accept real-world loss to follow-up

### Domain 8: PRIMARY OUTCOME

**How relevant is the primary outcome to participants?**

```
1 (Explanatory)                            5 (Pragmatic)
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
Intermediate,                             Patient-important,
surrogate,                                meaningful in
mechanistic                               daily life

Example:
Explanatory (1): HbA1c, LDL-C (biomarkers)
Pragmatic (5): Cardiovascular events, mortality, quality of life
```

**Pragmatic Approach:**
- Outcomes that matter to patients and decision-makers
- Long-term, clinically meaningful
- Feasible to measure in routine practice
- Avoid surrogate endpoints when possible

### Domain 9: PRIMARY ANALYSIS

**To what extent are all data included?**

```
1 (Explanatory)                            5 (Pragmatic)
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
Per-protocol,                             Intention-to-treat
exclude non-                              (ITT), all

lost patients                             participants

Example:
Explanatory (1): Only participants completing ≥80% of protocol
Pragmatic (5): All randomized, regardless of adherence or completion
```

**Pragmatic Approach:**
- Strict intention-to-treat analysis
- Include all randomized participants
- Analyze as randomized, regardless of treatment received
- Reflects real-world utilization patterns

       Primary Analysis (5)

Score: 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic)
```

**Interpretation:**
- All domains ≥4: Highly pragmatic trial
- Mixed scores: Hybrid trial (pragmatic in some aspects, explanatory in others)
- All domains ≤2: Highly explanatory trial

**Design Decision:** Not all domains need to be maximally pragmatic. Choose based on:
- Research question
- Feasibility
- Regulatory requirements
- Resource constraints

---

## Pragmatic Trial Design Template

### 1. Research Question

**Format:** "Does [intervention] improve [patient-important outcome] when delivered in [real-world setting] to [broad population]?"

**Example:**
```
"Does a practice-based depression care program improve depression remission 
and quality of life when delivered by primary care staff in diverse 
community primary care practices to adults with major depression?"
```

### 2. Study Design

**Type:** Pragmatic randomized controlled trial

**Randomization:**
- Level: [Individual, cluster (practice/clinic), stepped-wedge]
- Allocation: [1:1, 1:2, other]
- Stratification: [By site, baseline severity, etc.]

**Blinding:**
- Participants: [Typically not blinded in pragmatic trials]
- Providers: [Typically not blinded]
- Outcome assessors: [Blinded when possible]
- Analysts: [Blinded when possible]

**Example:**
```
Cluster-randomized trial
- Unit: Primary care practice (n=50 practices)
- Randomization: 1:1 (25 intervention, 25 usual care)
- Stratification: By practice size (small <3 providers, large ≥3)
- Blinding: Outcome assessors blinded, participants/providers unblinded
```

### 3. Population

**Eligibility (PRECIS-2 Domain 1):**

**Inclusion:**
- [Broad criteria reflecting real-world patients]
- [Minimal exclusions]

**Exclusion:**
- [Only if unsafe or unethical]
- [Avoid excluding based on comorbidities, severity, demographics]

**Example:**
```
Inclusion:
- Adults ≥18 years
- Diagnosis of major depression (PHQ-9 ≥10 or clinician diagnosis)
- Receiving care at participating practice

Exclusion:
- Active suicidal ideation requiring immediate intervention
- Bipolar disorder or psychotic disorder
- Receiving specialty mental health care
```

**Recruitment (PRECIS-2 Domain 2):**
- Primary care providers identify eligible patients during routine visits
- Electronic health record (EHR) alerts for patients with PHQ-9 ≥10
- Brief in-person recruitment by practice staff
- No advertising, no incentives for participation

**Target Sample Size:** [Calculate with expected real-world effect size]

### 4. Intervention

**Setting (PRECIS-2 Domain 3):**
- [Describe routine care settings]
- [Geographic diversity, resource variation]

**Organisation (PRECIS-2 Domain 4):**
- [Who delivers intervention? Usual providers or specialists?]
- [Training provided (pragmatic = minimal, scalable)]
- [Resources required (pragmatic = existing resources)]

**Delivery (PRECIS-2 Domain 5):**
- [Core components that must be delivered]
- [Allowed adaptations/flexibility]
- [How providers tailor to patients and context]

**Example:**
```
Setting:
- 50 diverse community primary care practices (urban, suburban, rural)
- Safety-net clinics (40%), commercially insured (60%)
- Practice size: 2-12 providers

Organisation:
- Delivered by practice behavioral health staff (social workers, counselors)
- 4-hour online training (depression care management, problem-solving therapy)
- No additional staff hired; uses existing care management staff

Delivery:
- Core Components (required):
  * Initial assessment and treatment planning
  * Evidence-based psychotherapy (PST or BA)
  * Medication management support
  * Systematic outcome monitoring (PHQ-9 monthly)
  * Care coordination with PCP
  
- Flexible Elements (adapted to patient/practice):
  * Session frequency (weekly to monthly)
  * Session length (20-60 minutes)
  * Delivery mode (in-person, phone, video)
  * Number of sessions (6-12 over 6 months)
  * PST vs. BA choice (provider/patient preference)
```

### 5. Comparison

**Usual Care:**
- [Describe what usual care looks like in your settings]
- [Do NOT restrict usual care - allow any treatment]
- [Monitor what usual care patients actually receive]

**Example:**
```
Usual Care:
- Primary care providers manage depression as per their usual practice
- May include: Antidepressant medications, brief counseling, referral to
  specialty mental health (if available), watchful waiting
- No restrictions on care; all usual treatments allowed
- Enhanced usual care: Practices receive depression screening results but
  no additional resources
```

### 6. Outcomes

**Primary Outcome (PRECIS-2 Domain 8):**
- [Patient-important outcome]
- [Clinically meaningful]
- [Feasible to measure in routine practice]

**Secondary Outcomes:**
- [Additional patient-important outcomes]
- [Implementation outcomes (reach, adoption, sustainability)]
- [Cost-effectiveness]

**Data Collection:**
- [From EHR, registries, patient-reported via patient portal]
- [Aligned with routine care when possible]

**Example:**
```
Primary Outcome:
- Depression remission at 12 months (PHQ-9 <5)
- Assessed via patient portal or phone survey

Secondary Outcomes:
- Depression response (≥50% reduction PHQ-9)
- Quality of life (EQ-5D-5L)
- Functional impairment (WHODAS 2.0)
- Suicidal ideation (PHQ-9 item 9)
- Healthcare utilization (EHR: ED visits, hospitalizations)
- Antidepressant use (EHR: prescriptions filled)

Implementation Outcomes:
- Reach: % eligible patients who engage in program
- Adoption: % practices successfully implementing core components
- Sustainability: Program continuation 12 months post-funding

Cost-Effectiveness:
- Incremental cost per QALY gained
- Healthcare costs (visits, medications, hospitalizations)
- Program costs (staff time, training, supervision)
```

**Follow-Up (PRECIS-2 Domain 7):**
- Baseline, 6 months, 12 months
- Surveys timed with routine care visits when possible
- EHR data extraction (minimizes burden)
- Accept real-world loss to follow-up (report in CONSORT diagram)

### 7. Adherence and Fidelity

**Adherence (PRECIS-2 Domain 6):**
- No trial-specific adherence interventions
- Usual care adherence support only (e.g., prescription refill reminders)
- Track adherence for descriptive purposes, not to exclude

**Fidelity:**
- Monitor core component delivery (not strict protocol adherence)
- Light-touch fidelity monitoring (e.g., documentation review)
- Allow adaptation within fidelity to core components

**Example:**
```
Adherence:
- No additional adherence support beyond usual care
- Track: # sessions attended, medications filled

Fidelity:
- Core Component Checklist (5 items, documented in EHR)
- Audit 10% of encounters per provider annually
- Feedback to providers if <80% core component delivery
- Allow flexible implementation of each component
```

### 8. Sample Size

**Considerations for Pragmatic Trials:**
- Use realistic effect sizes (smaller than efficacy trials)
- Account for clustering (if cluster RCT)
- Account for real-world loss to follow-up (higher than efficacy trials)
- Power for subgroup analyses if examining heterogeneous treatment effects

**Example Calculation:**
```
Outcome: Depression remission (binary)
Expected Rates:
  - Usual Care: 30%
  - Intervention: 42% (difference = 12%, NNT = 8)
  (Conservative estimate based on effectiveness trials)

Design:
  - Cluster RCT (practice-level)
  - 50 practices (25 per arm)
  - ICC = 0.02 (low clustering for patient-level outcome)
  - Average cluster size = 40 patients/practice

Power Calculation:
  - Alpha = 0.05 (two-tailed)
  - Power = 0.80
  - Design effect = 1 + (40-1) × 0.02 = 1.78
  
  Effective n = 2000 / 1.78 = 1,124 per arm
  Actual n needed = 1,124 × 1.78 = 2,000 per arm (40 per practice × 50 practices)
  
  With 20% loss to follow-up:
  Final n = 2,000 / 0.80 = 2,500 total (50 patients/practice × 50 practices)
```

### 9. Analysis Plan (PRECIS-2 Domain 9)

**Primary Analysis:**

**Intention-to-Treat (ITT):**
- Analyze all randomized participants as randomized
- Include all patients regardless of:
  * Whether they engaged in intervention
  * Treatment adherence level
  * Whether they received intervention as intended
  * Loss to follow-up (use imputation methods)

**Statistical Approach:**
```
Primary Outcome: Depression remission at 12 months

Model: Generalized estimating equation (GEE) or mixed-effects logistic regression

  logit(P(remission)) = β0 + β1(intervention) + β2(baseline PHQ-9) + 
                        β3(site) + random(practice)

Covariates:
  - Baseline depression severity (PHQ-9 continuous)
  - Stratification variable (practice size)

Clustering:
  - Account for practice-level clustering (random intercept or GEE)

Missing Data:
  - Multiple imputation (m=20 imputations)
  - Auxiliary variables: baseline characteristics, intermediate outcomes
  - Sensitivity analysis: Complete case, worst-case/best-case scenarios
```

**Secondary Analyses:**

1. **Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE):**
   - Examine if intervention works differently for subgroups
   - Pre-specified subgroups: Baseline severity, comorbidities, demographics
   - Test treatment × subgroup interaction

2. **Per-Protocol Analysis:**
   - Sensitivity analysis
   - Define "received intervention" (e.g., attended ≥4 sessions)
   - Compare to ITT results

3. **Implementation Outcomes:**
   - Reach: % eligible who enrolled
   - Adoption: % practices delivering core components
   - Descriptive, reported separately

4. **Cost-Effectiveness:**
   - Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)
   - Cost per QALY gained
   - Budget impact analysis

**Example Analysis Output:**
```
Primary Outcome: Depression Remission at 12 Months

Intention-to-Treat Analysis:
  Intervention:  42.3% (423/1000) remitted
  Usual Care:    31.8% (318/1000) remitted
  
  Difference:    10.5% (95% CI: 4.2% to 16.8%)
  Adjusted OR:   1.58 (95% CI: 1.22 to 2.05)
  P-value:       0.001
  NNT:           10 (95% CI: 6 to 24)

Interpretation: Practice-based depression care program increases remission 
                by 10.5 percentage points. For every 10 patients treated, 
                1 additional patient achieves remission compared to usual care.

Heterogeneous Treatment Effects:
  Baseline PHQ-9 <15 (mild-moderate): OR = 1.32 (95% CI: 0.91 to 1.92), p=0.14
  Baseline PHQ-9 ≥15 (severe):       OR = 1.98 (95% CI: 1.38 to 2.85), p<0.001
  Interaction p = 0.047
  
  Interpretation: Intervention more effective for patients with severe depression.
```
