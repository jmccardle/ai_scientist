## What is Quality Improvement?

**Quality Improvement (QI)** is the systematic use of methods and strategies to continuously improve the quality and safety of healthcare systems.

**QI vs. Research:**

Purpose               Generate generalizable    Improve local processes
                      knowledge                 and outcomes

Question              Does it work?             How can we improve?
                      (efficacy)                (local implementation)

Setting               Controlled, can be        Real-world, local
                      multi-site                setting (1 hospital,
                                                clinic, unit)

Methods               Strict protocol,          Iterative, flexible,
                      predetermined             adaptive

Control Group         Usually required          Often not used

Intervention          Fixed                     Evolves over time
                                                (PDSA cycles)

Generalizability      External validity         Local context-specific

Ethics Review         Always IRB required       Often QI exception
                                                (check institutional
                                                policy)

**When to conduct QI (not research):**
- Implementing known effective interventions locally
- Improving existing processes
- Addressing local performance gaps
- Primary goal is improvement, not generalization
- Iterative learning and adaptation expected

## Model for Improvement: Three Questions + PDSA

### The Three Fundamental Questions

**1. What are we trying to accomplish?**
→ **Aim Statement** (SMART goal)

**2. How will we know that a change is an improvement?**
→ **Measures** (Outcome, Process, Balancing)

**3. What changes can we make that will result in improvement?**
→ **Change Ideas** (interventions to test)

### PDSA Cycles

**Plan-Do-Study-Act** cycles are small, iterative tests of change.

```

**PDSA Phases:**

**PLAN:**
- State objective of this cycle
- Make predictions (what do you expect to happen?)
- Plan who, what, where, when

**DO:**
- Carry out the plan
- Document observations and data
- Note problems and unexpected findings

**STUDY:**
- Analyze the data
- Compare results to predictions
- Summarize what was learned

**ACT:**
- Decide what to do next
  * **Adopt:** Implement change widely
  * **Adapt:** Modify and test again
  * **Abandon:** Try a different change

## QI Project Template

### 1. Problem Description

**What is the problem?**
- Current state vs. desired state
- Why is this important? (patient safety, outcomes, efficiency, experience)
- How big is the problem? (baseline data)

**Example:**
```
PROBLEM: High Rate of Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injuries

Current State:
- Pressure injury rate: 8.2 per 1,000 patient-days (Q1 2024)
- National benchmark: <2.5 per 1,000 patient-days
- 95% of injuries are Stage 2 or higher
- Most common sites: Sacrum (45%), heels (32%)

Impact:
- Patient: Pain, delayed discharge, increased infection risk
- System: Increased LOS by average 4.2 days, added costs ~$15,000/injury
- 127 pressure injuries in Q1 → estimated $1.9M in preventable costs

Desired State:
- Reduce pressure injury rate to <3.0 per 1,000 patient-days
- Eliminate all hospital-acquired Stage 3+ injuries
```

### 2. Setting and Local Context

**Where is the QI project taking place?**
- Specific unit(s), hospital(s), clinic(s)
- Organizational context (academic, community, safety-net)
- Population served
- Relevant contextual factors (staffing, resources, culture)

**Example:**
```
Setting:
- 450-bed academic medical center
- Focus: Medical-Surgical units (4 units, 120 beds total)
- Patient population: Adults ≥18 years, average LOS 5.7 days
- Nurse-to-patient ratio: 1:5 (day), 1:6 (night)
- Existing infrastructure:
  * Electronic health record (EHR): Epic
  * Braden Scale risk assessment (required Q48h)
  * Wound care nurse consultants available

Contextual Challenges:
- High nursing turnover (18% annually)
- Mix of experienced and new graduate nurses
- Competing priorities (fall prevention, infection control, etc.)
- Physician resistance to frequent repositioning orders
```

### 3. Aim Statement

**SMART format:**
- **S**pecific: What exactly will improve?
- **M**easurable: How much improvement?
- **A**chievable: Is it realistic given context?
- **R**elevant: Does it address the problem?
- **T**ime-bound: By when?

**Template:**
```
"We aim to [improve/reduce/increase] [specific measure] from [baseline]
 to [target] by [date] in [setting]."
```

**Example:**
```
PRIMARY AIM:
"We aim to reduce hospital-acquired pressure injury rate from 8.2 to <3.0
 per 1,000 patient-days by December 31, 2024 (12 months) on the four
 medical-surgical units at University Hospital."

SECONDARY AIM:
"We aim to achieve 95% compliance with pressure injury prevention bundle
 (repositioning Q2h, skin assessment Q shift, support surfaces for high-risk
 patients) by June 30, 2024 (6 months)."
```

### 4. Measures

**Three Types of Measures:**

**A. Outcome Measures** (Did we improve patient outcomes?)

```
Primary Outcome:
- Pressure injury rate (per 1,000 patient-days)
- Calculation: (# new hospital-acquired pressure injuries / total patient-days) × 1,000

Secondary Outcomes:
- Pressure injury severity (% Stage 1, 2, 3, 4)
- Time to injury detection (hours from admission)
```

**B. Process Measures** (Are we implementing the intervention?)

```
Process Measures (Bundle Compliance):
- % patients repositioned Q2h (target: 95%)
- % high-risk patients on pressure-reducing mattress (target: 100%)
- % patients with documented skin assessment Q shift (target: 95%)
- % Braden Scale assessments completed within 8h of admission (target: 100%)
```

**C. Balancing Measures** (Are we causing unintended harm?)

```
Balancing Measures:
- Fall rate (ensure repositioning doesn't increase falls)
- Nurse satisfaction/workload (survey Q3 months)
- Cost per patient-day (ensure intervention is sustainable)
- Patient sleep disruption complaints (Q2h repositioning)
```

**Data Collection:**
- **Source:** EHR, direct observation, surveys
- **Frequency:** Outcome (monthly), Process (weekly), Balancing (monthly)
- **Responsible:** Wound care nurse, unit charge nurses, QI team

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### 6. Intervention (Bundle of Changes)

**Describe the intervention:**
- What changes were implemented?
- How were they implemented? (education, workflow redesign, tools, etc.)
- Who was involved? (champions, stakeholders, frontline staff)

**Example:**
```
PRESSURE INJURY PREVENTION BUNDLE

Change 1: Automated Risk Stratification
  - EHR modification: Braden Scale auto-calculated from nursing assessment
  - EHR alert fires if Braden ≤12 (high risk)
  - Alert prompts: Order pressure-reducing mattress, repositioning protocol

Change 2: Structured Repositioning Protocol
  - Q2h repositioning for all patients (30° lateral, alternating sides)
  - Visual aid in patient room (repositioning clock)
  - EHR documentation: Checkbox for each repositioning, auto-timestamped

Change 3: Staff Education
  - 30-minute online module (mandatory for all nursing staff)
  - Topics: Braden Scale, staging, prevention bundle, documentation
  - Skills lab: Hands-on practice with repositioning techniques
  - Competency assessment (must score 80%+)

Change 4: Daily Skin Rounds
  - Wound care nurse rounds on high-risk patients daily (M-F)
  - Early detection of Stage 1 injuries
  - Real-time coaching for bedside nurses

Change 5: Unit-Level Dashboard
  - Weekly scorecard: Pressure injury rate, bundle compliance %
  - Posted in break room, discussed at huddles
  - Units compete for lowest injury rate (monthly recognition)

Implementation Timeline:
- Month 1-2: EHR build, staff education
- Month 3: Pilot on Unit A (1 unit, 30 beds)
- Month 4-5: Spread to Units B, C, D (phased rollout)
- Month 6-12: Ongoing monitoring, refinement, sustainability
```

### 7. PDSA Cycles

**Document iterative tests of change:**

**PDSA Cycle 1: Pilot Repositioning Protocol on Unit A**

```
PLAN (What):
Objective: Test feasibility of Q2h repositioning protocol on one unit
Prediction: We predict 70% compliance in first 2 weeks, identifying workflow barriers
Who: Unit A nurses (25 nurses, 30 beds)
When: Weeks 1-2 of pilot (February 1-14)
Data: Audit EHR documentation daily

DO (Implement):
- Educated Unit A staff (1-hour in-person training)
- Installed repositioning clocks in all rooms
- Activated EHR checkbox documentation
- Wound care nurse available for questions

Observations:
- Compliance Week 1: 62% (186/300 expected repositionings documented)
- Compliance Week 2: 68% (204/300)
- Barriers identified:
  * Nurses forget to document (even when repositioning done)
  * Confusion about repositioning sleeping patients
  * Difficulty repositioning bariatric patients (need lift team)

STUDY (Analyze):
- Compliance lower than predicted (68% vs. 70%)
- Main barrier: Documentation, not actual repositioning
- Nurses report "we're doing it, just forgetting to check the box"
- Bariatric patients (n=4) not repositioned Q2h

Learning:
- Need documentation reminders (EHR pop-up?)
- Clarify protocol: Reposition sleeping patients unless contraindicated
- Bariatric patients need special protocol (lift team coordination)

ACT (Next Steps):
ADAPT: Modify protocol and test again in Cycle 2
- Add EHR reminder (pop-up at 2h since last repositioning)
- Create bariatric repositioning protocol (Q4h with 2-person assist/lift)
- Add FAQ to address sleep concerns ("Yes, reposition unless sleeping after procedure")
```

**PDSA Cycle 2: Test Modified Protocol with EHR Reminder**

```
PLAN (What):
Objective: Test if EHR reminder improves compliance
Prediction: Compliance will increase to 85%
Who: Unit A (same unit)
When: Weeks 3-4 (February 15-28)

DO (Implement):
- Activated EHR reminder (pop-up at 2h, 4h, 6h intervals)
- Implemented bariatric protocol
- Continued monitoring

Observations:
- Compliance Week 3: 81%
- Compliance Week 4: 87%
- Bariatric compliance: 100% with Q4h protocol
- Nurses report reminder is helpful but "a bit annoying" at night

STUDY (Analyze):
- Compliance improved significantly (87% vs. 68%)
- EHR reminder effective
- Bariatric protocol working well
- Night shift compliance still lower (78% vs. 92% day shift)

Learning:
- EHR reminder successful - keep for rollout
- Night shift needs targeted intervention

ACT (Next Steps):
ADOPT: Implement on Units B, C, D
ADAPT: Add night shift-specific support
- Night charge nurse to prompt team at start of shift
- Reduce reminder frequency at night (Q4h instead of Q2h pop-up)
```

**PDSA Cycle 3-5:** [Continue documenting cycles as you spread, adapt, and sustain]

library(qicharts2)

# Data
data <- data.frame(
  month = 1:16,
  injuries = c(32, 35, 38, 34, 36, 30, 25, 22, 20, 18, 16, 15, 12, 11, 10, 9),
  patient_days = rep(4000, 16)  # Assume 4000 patient-days/month
)

data$rate <- (data$injuries / data$patient_days) * 1000

# Control chart
qic(month, rate, data = data,
    chart = 'i',  # Individuals chart
    main = 'Pressure Injury Rate',
    ylab = 'Rate per 1,000 patient-days',
    xlab = 'Month')
```

### 9. Analysis and Results

**Descriptive Statistics:**
- Baseline vs. post-intervention comparison
- Trend over time
- Subgroup analyses (by unit, shift, etc.)

**Example Results:**
```
OUTCOME MEASURES:

Primary Outcome: Pressure Injury Rate
  Baseline (Jan-Feb 2024):        8.2 per 1,000 patient-days (n=68 injuries)
  Post-Intervention (Mar-Dec 2024): 2.8 per 1,000 patient-days (n=112 injuries)
  
  Absolute Reduction: 5.4 per 1,000 patient-days (66% reduction)
  Statistical Process Control: Special cause variation detected (8+ points below centerline)
  
  Interpretation: Sustained improvement, goal achieved (target <3.0)

Pressure Injury Severity:
  Baseline: Stage 1 (22%), Stage 2 (58%), Stage 3+ (20%)
  Post:     Stage 1 (45%), Stage 2 (50%), Stage 3+ (5%)
  
  Interpretation: Shift to less severe injuries (early detection working)

PROCESS MEASURES:

Bundle Compliance (Post-Intervention Average):
  - Repositioning Q2h:          87% (target 95%, not met)
  - Pressure-reducing mattress: 98% (target 100%, nearly met)
  - Skin assessment Q shift:    93% (target 95%, nearly met)
  - Braden <8h of admission:   100% (target 100%, met)

BALANCING MEASURES:

Falls: No change (2.1 vs. 2.0 per 1,000 patient-days, p=0.89)
Nurse Satisfaction: Improved (3.2 → 3.7 on 5-point scale, p=0.02)
Cost: Net savings of $1.6M annually (reduced injury costs exceed intervention costs)

### 10. Sustainability Plan

**How will improvements be maintained?**

```
SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGIES:

1. Embedding in Workflow
   - EHR alerts and reminders permanently activated
   - Pressure injury bundle integrated into standard orientation
   - Monthly review at Nursing Quality Council

2. Ongoing Monitoring
   - Continue tracking pressure injury rate (monthly report to executives)
   - Process measure audits (quarterly instead of weekly)
   - Annual staff competency reassessment

3. Spread to Other Units
   - Implement bundle hospital-wide (ICU, Oncology, Rehabilitation)
   - Develop "Pressure Injury Prevention Champion" role on each unit
   - Share success story at hospital Grand Rounds

4. Continuous Improvement
   - Set new goal: Reduce to <2.0 per 1,000 (benchmark level)
   - Pilot additional interventions:
     * Prophylactic silicone foam dressings for high-risk areas
     * Patient/family education video
   - Monitor long-term trends, respond if backsliding

5. Resources
   - Secure ongoing funding for pressure-reducing mattresses
   - Maintain wound care nurse FTE for daily rounding
   - Budget for annual training updates

6. Leadership Accountability
   - Pressure injury rate included in nursing director performance metrics
   - Quarterly report to Board Quality Committee
   - Executive rounding to reinforce importance

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Calling research "QI"** - If primary goal is generalizable knowledge, it's research (needs IRB)
2. **No baseline data** - Must know starting point to measure improvement
3. **Vague aim statement** - Use SMART format with specific targets and timeline
4. **Skipping PDSA cycles** - QI requires iterative testing, not one-time implementation
5. **Ignoring context** - What works elsewhere may not work in your setting
6. **No balancing measures** - Must monitor for unintended consequences
7. **Declaring success too early** - Ensure sustained improvement (6+ months)
8. **Not engaging frontline staff** - QI succeeds when staff are involved, not mandated
