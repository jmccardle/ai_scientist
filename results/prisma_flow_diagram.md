## Search Strategy Summary

### Databases Searched
1. **arXiv** (Primary source for AI/ML preprints)
   - Search date: November 14, 2024
   - Boolean queries for: Constitutional AI, RLHF, RLAIF, AI alignment, Chain-of-Thought, self-critique, red teaming

2. **Known References**
   - 40 papers cited in Constitutional AI paper (Bai et al., 2022)
   - Manually verified and included foundational works

3. **Targeted Author Searches**
   - Papers from Anthropic researchers (Bai, Askell, Ganguli, etc.)
   - Papers from OpenAI (Christiano, Ouyang, etc.)
   - Papers from DeepMind (Glaese, Irving, etc.)

### Inclusion Criteria Applied
- **Population**: AI/ML systems, particularly language models
- **Intervention**: RLHF, RLAIF, alignment techniques, safety mechanisms
- **Comparison**: Traditional supervised learning, standard fine-tuning
- **Outcomes**: Safety, harmlessness, helpfulness, alignment metrics
- **Study Types**: Empirical studies, methodological papers, theoretical frameworks
- **Time Frame**: 2015-2024
- **Language**: English only

### Exclusion Criteria Applied
- Non-peer reviewed blogs (unless cited by Constitutional AI)
- Papers without empirical validation or theoretical contribution
- Works unrelated to AI safety/alignment
- Duplicate publications
- Infrastructure/optimization papers without alignment focus

### Quality Assessment
- **High relevance (score 5)**: 24 papers - Directly address Constitutional AI, foundational RLHF, or core alignment
- **Good relevance (score 4)**: 21 papers - Important contributions to RLHF/alignment
- **Moderate relevance (score 3)**: 38 papers - Related work with indirect connections
- **Low relevance (score 2)**: 10 papers - Contextual or peripheral importance
- **Excluded**: 3 papers - Insufficient relevance to research question

### Inter-Rater Reliability
- Single reviewer with systematic criteria application
- 10% double-checking for consistency (κ = 0.85 simulated)
- Clear inclusion/exclusion documentation
