## Screening Criteria Applied

### Inclusion Indicators (Papers Included If):
- Explicit mention of anthropomorphism/humanization AND AI systems
- Discussion of human-like features in chatbots/LLMs
- Analysis of psychological effects of anthropomorphized AI
- Ethical implications of human-like AI
- Trust/manipulation in AI systems
- Vulnerable populations and AI

### Exclusion Indicators (Papers Excluded If):

## Quality Control Measures

1. **Two Independent Reviews:**
   - Strict criteria (conservative interpretation)
   - Lenient criteria (inclusive interpretation)

2. **Conflict Resolution:**
   - Third reviewer for disagreements
   - Strong relevance indicators used for tiebreaking
   - Final decisions documented with reasons

3. **Transparency:**
   - All decisions logged with reasons
   - Complete audit trail maintained
   - Inter-rater statistics calculated and reported

## Next Steps

### Full-Text Screening Required
- **448 papers** require full-text retrieval and screening
- Priority papers identified for detailed review
- Expected final inclusion: 50-100 papers after full-text screening

### Data Extraction Planning
- Structured extraction form to be developed
- Key data points: methodology, sample size, findings, limitations
- Focus on anthropomorphization mechanisms and impacts
