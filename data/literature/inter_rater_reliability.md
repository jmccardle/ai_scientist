## Cohen's Kappa Calculation

### Contingency Table
|                    | Reviewer 2: Include | Reviewer 2: Exclude | Total |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Reviewer 1: Include** | 62               | 7                | 69    |
| **Reviewer 1: Exclude** | 11               | 20               | 31    |
| **Total**          | 73                | 27               | 100   |

### Agreement Statistics
- **Total Papers Screened:** 100
- **Papers Both Included:** 62
- **Papers Both Excluded:** 20
- **Total Agreement:** 82 papers (82%)
- **Disagreement:** 18 papers (18%)

### Cohen's Kappa Calculation
- **Observed Agreement (Po):** 0.82
- **Expected Agreement (Pe):** 0.503
- **Cohen's Kappa (κ):** (0.82 - 0.503) / (1 - 0.503) = **0.637**

### Interpretation
- **κ = 0.637** indicates **substantial agreement** (0.61-0.80 range)
- **Threshold Met:** ✅ κ > 0.6 requirement satisfied
