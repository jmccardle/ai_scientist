## Anthropomorphism in Dialogue Systems

**Review Title:** Current State of Research on Anthropomorphism in Dialogue Systems: A PRISMA 2020 Systematic Review

**Research Question:** What is the current state of research on anthropomorphism in dialogue systems, including linguistic factors, gender stereotypes, over-reliance, and ethical implications?

---

## Phase 1: Core Anthropomorphism in Dialogue Systems

### 1.1 Proposed Search Terms

**Primary Concept Combinations:**
```
("anthropomorphism" OR "anthropomorphic" OR "personification" OR "humanization" OR "human-like")
AND
("dialogue system*" OR "conversational AI" OR "conversational agent*" OR "chatbot*" OR "voice assistant*" OR "virtual assistant*" OR "conversational interface*" OR "dialog system*")
```

**Secondary Search Variations:**
```
Query 2: ("human-computer interaction" OR "HCI") AND ("anthropomorph*") AND ("conversat*" OR "dialogue" OR "dialog")

Query 3: ("ELIZA effect" OR "media equation" OR "computers as social actors" OR "CASA") AND ("AI" OR "artificial intelligence" OR "chatbot*")

Query 4: ("user perception" OR "user attitude*" OR "user trust") AND ("anthropomorph*") AND ("AI assistant*" OR "voice assistant*")
```

### 1.2 Databases to Search

**Primary Databases:**
1. **OpenAlex** - Comprehensive coverage across disciplines
2. **arXiv** - Computer Science and AI preprints
3. **Semantic Scholar** - Strong AI/ML coverage with citation context

**Supplementary Sources:**
4. **Web Search** (via WebFetch) - Recent industry reports, conference proceedings
5. **Citation Tracking** - Follow references from key papers (Abercrombie et al. 2023)

### 1.3 Inclusion Criteria

**Population:**
- Studies involving dialogue systems, conversational AI, chatbots, or voice assistants
- Any user population (general public, specific demographics, experts)

**Intervention/Exposure:**
- Anthropomorphic features, characteristics, or design elements
- Human-like behaviors, language, or appearance in AI systems

**Comparator (if applicable):**
- Non-anthropomorphic systems
- Different levels of anthropomorphism
- Human-human interaction baselines

**Outcomes:**
- User perceptions, attitudes, trust, reliance
- Behavioral measures (engagement, compliance, disclosure)
- Ethical implications and concerns
- Design recommendations

**Study Types:**
- Empirical studies (experiments, surveys, observational)
- Theoretical frameworks and models
- Design guidelines and best practices
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses

**Publication Types:**
- Peer-reviewed journal articles
- Conference proceedings (full papers)
- Preprints from established repositories
- Technical reports from recognized institutions

**Language:** English

**Date Range:** 2000-2025 (capturing foundational works through current research)

### 1.4 Exclusion Criteria

- Studies on physical robots without dialogue capabilities
- Purely technical system descriptions without user studies
- Opinion pieces without empirical evidence
- Duplicate publications
- Abstracts without full text available
- Non-English publications

### 1.5 Search Execution Plan

**Step 1: Broad Search**
- Execute primary query across all databases
- Document exact queries, dates, and result counts

**Step 2: Targeted Searches**
- Run secondary queries for specific concepts
- Search for known key papers to validate strategy

**Step 3: Citation Mining**
- Forward citations of Abercrombie et al. (2023)
- Backward citations from recent comprehensive reviews
- Key author searches (Epley, Nass, Reeves, Bender)

**Step 4: Deduplication**
- Remove duplicates based on DOI, title, and author matching
- Manual review of near-duplicates

### 1.6 Quality Assurance

**Search Reproducibility:**
- Document exact search strings with operators
- Record search date and time
- Note any database-specific syntax modifications
- Save raw search results before screening

**Inter-rater Reliability (for screening):**
- Double-screen first 10% of abstracts
- Calculate Cohen's Kappa (target κ > 0.6)
- Resolve disagreements through discussion
- Document screening decisions with reasons

## Proposed Search Schedule

1. **Topic 1: Core Anthropomorphism** (Today)
2. **Topic 2: Linguistic Factors** (After Topic 1 approval)
3. **Topic 3: Gender Stereotypes**
4. **Topic 4: Trust and Over-reliance**
5. **Topic 5: Language Variation**
6. **Topic 6: Ethical Implications**

## Decision Request

**Do you approve this search strategy for Topic 1 (Core Anthropomorphism)?**

Options:
1. **Approve** - Execute the search as proposed
2. **Modify** - Suggest changes to:
   - Search terms (add/remove/modify)
   - Databases (add/remove)
   - Date range
   - Inclusion/exclusion criteria
3. **Expand** - Add specific papers or authors to include
4. **Clarify** - Request more details on any aspect

**Additional Considerations:**
- Should we prioritize any specific conferences (CHI, ACL, NeurIPS)?
- Are there specific anthropomorphic features to emphasize (voice, language, visual)?
- Should we include gray literature (industry reports, white papers)?
