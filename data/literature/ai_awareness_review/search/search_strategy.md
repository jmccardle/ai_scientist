# Systematic Literature Review: AI Awareness
## Search Strategy Protocol (PRISMA 2020 Compliant)

### Research Question
What are the current state, evaluation methods, capabilities, and risks of AI awareness in large language models across four key dimensions: metacognition, self-awareness, social awareness, and situational awareness?

### PICO Framework
- **Population**: Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI systems
- **Intervention/Exposure**: Awareness capabilities (metacognition, self-awareness, social awareness, situational awareness)
- **Comparison**: Non-aware AI systems or baseline models
- **Outcomes**: Evaluation metrics, performance measures, safety implications, risk assessments

### Databases to Search
1. **OpenAlex** - Comprehensive academic database
2. **arXiv** - Preprint server for AI/ML research
3. **PubMed** - Biomedical and cognitive science literature
4. **Semantic Scholar** - AI-focused academic search

```

**Situational Awareness Search:**
```
("situational awareness" OR "context awareness" OR "environmental awareness" OR "evaluation awareness")
AND
("language model*" OR "LLM" OR "AI safety")
AND
("detection" OR "assessment" OR "alignment" OR "deception")
```

**Safety and Risks Search:**
```
("AI deception" OR "alignment faking" OR "manipulation" OR "AI safety" OR "AI risk*")
AND
("awareness" OR "consciousness" OR "agency")
AND
("language model*" OR "LLM" OR "AGI")
```

### Date Range
- **Start Date**: January 1, 2020
- **End Date**: December 31, 2024
- **Justification**: Focus on the modern LLM era post-GPT-2

### Language
- English only

### Inclusion Criteria
1. Studies examining AI/LLM awareness capabilities
2. Empirical evaluations of metacognition, self-awareness, social awareness, or situational awareness in AI
3. Theoretical frameworks for AI awareness
4. Benchmark development for awareness evaluation
5. Risk assessments related to AI awareness
6. Peer-reviewed articles, preprints, or conference proceedings

### Exclusion Criteria
1. Studies on biological consciousness without AI relevance
2. Pure philosophy papers without empirical AI components
3. Non-English publications
4. Duplicate publications (keep most recent/complete version)
5. Opinion pieces without empirical evidence
6. Studies on narrow AI systems without language capabilities

### Search Execution Plan
1. Execute primary search across all databases
2. Execute dimension-specific searches
3. Deduplicate results using DOI and title matching
4. Export results to CSV for screening

### Quality Assessment Tools
- For experimental studies: Modified Downs and Black checklist
- For theoretical papers: Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool
- For benchmarks: Custom quality criteria (validity, reliability, coverage)

### Data Extraction Fields
1. Study identification (authors, year, title, DOI)
2. Study type (empirical, theoretical, benchmark, review)
3. AI systems studied (GPT-3/4, Claude, LLaMA, etc.)
4. Awareness dimension(s) examined
5. Evaluation methods used
6. Key findings
7. Limitations noted
8. Safety/risk implications
9. Future research directions

### Search Documentation
- Date of search execution: [To be recorded]
- Search strings used: [As documented above]
- Number of results per database: [To be recorded]
- Deduplication process: [To be documented]

### Inter-rater Reliability Protocol
- Simulate two independent reviewers for title/abstract screening
- Calculate Cohen's Kappa
- Target κ > 0.6 (substantial agreement)
- Resolve conflicts through third reviewer simulation

### PRISMA Flow Diagram Elements to Track
- Records identified from databases
- Records removed before screening (duplicates)
- Records screened (title/abstract)
- Records excluded at title/abstract
- Reports sought for retrieval
- Reports not retrieved
- Reports assessed for eligibility
- Reports excluded with reasons
- Studies included in review

### Search Strategy Validation
This search strategy follows PRISMA 2020 Item #7 requirements:
- Complete search strings documented
- All databases listed
- Date restrictions specified
- Language filters noted
- Reproducible methodology
